Expand the "LLM Bot Builder" project to add conversation memory and personality customization for each bot.

1. **Conversation Memory**
   - Create a new database table `conversations` with columns:
       * id (primary key)
       * bot_id
       * user_id
       * role (user/assistant/system)
       * message
       * timestamp
   - In /api/bots/<bot_id>/message:
       * Save each incoming user message and bot response into the `conversations` table.
       * When generating a new GPT-4 response, fetch the last N messages (configurable, e.g., last 10) for that bot and user to provide conversation context.
       * Pass this conversation history into openai_service.generate_response to maintain context across multiple messages.

2. **Bot Personality Settings**
   - In the bots table, add new fields:
       * personality_description (text)
       * tone (e.g., friendly, professional, humorous)
   - Update /api/bots routes to allow creating/updating these fields.
   - In openai_service.generate_response:
       * Prepend a system prompt that includes the bot's personality description and tone so the GPT-4 responses match the configured style.

3. **Frontend Updates**
   - In the dashboard bot creation/edit screen:
       * Add fields for Personality Description and Tone.
       * Allow saving and updating these settings.
   - Display conversation history in the chat interface for each bot.
   - Make the chat interface show the ongoing conversation and allow scrolling back.

4. **General**
   - Keep the conversation memory lightweight and configurable (allow setting how many past messages are used per request).
   - Ensure personality settings are stored per bot and automatically applied to all conversations for that bot.
   - Do not break existing knowledge base integration; combine conversation history + knowledge context when generating responses.

When finished, I should be able to:
- Have bots that remember previous messages in a conversation and respond with context.
- Configure each bot's personality and tone in the dashboard.
- See ongoing conversation history in the chat interface.
- Have GPT-4 responses reflect the bot's unique personality per client or business.
